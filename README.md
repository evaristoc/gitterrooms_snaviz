#Real Time GitterRooms Net Viz
###Simple Network Chart of users posting at gitter room

The project:
* Full JS stack
* Use gitter stream api
* Pass data to front-end (jQuery + d3.js) using socket.io
* Manipulate data and create a simple viz on real time

The project is a simple demo, but it is intended for further work in SNA of FreeCodeCamp's (FCC) Gitter Chatrooms for improving the FCC programme.

Thanks to Gitter Developers Room and the FreeCodeCamp's DataScience Room.
